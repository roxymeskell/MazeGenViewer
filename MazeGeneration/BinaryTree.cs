    /// Class to generate a maze using Binary Trees
    /// Extends MazeGeneration
    /// About algorithm --
    /// Simplest and fastest algorithm; but biased
    /// For each cell carve a passage either leading up or leading left, but not both.
    /// In the wall added version, for each vertex add a wall segment leading down or right, but not both.
    /// Each cell is independent of every other cell, where you don't have to refer to the state of any other cells when creating it.
    ///     Hence this is a true memoryless Maze generation algorithm, with no limit to the size of Maze you can create.
    ///     This is basically a computer science binary tree, if you consider the upper left corner the root,
    ///             where each node or cell has one unique parent which is the cell above or to the left of it.
    ///     Binary tree Mazes are different than standard perfect Mazes, since about half the cell types can never exist in them.
    ///     For example there will never be a crossroads, and all dead ends have passages pointing up or left, and never down or right.
    ///     The Maze tends to have passages leading diagonally from upper left to lower right, where the Maze is much easier to navigate from
    ///     lower right to upper left. You will always be able to travel up or left, but never both, so you can always deterministically travel
    ///     diagonally up and to the left without hitting any barriers.
    ///     Traveling down and to the right is when you'll encounter choices and dead ends.
    ///     Note if you flip a binary tree Maze upside down and treat passages as walls and vice versa, the result is basically another binary tree.
