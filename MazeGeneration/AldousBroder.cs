    /// About algorithm --
    /// The interesting thing about this algorithm is it generates all possible Mazes of a given size with equal probability. It also requires no extra storage or stack. Pick a point, and move to a neighboring cell at random. If an uncarved cell is entered, carve into it from the previous cell. Keep moving to neighboring cells until all cells have been carved into. This algorithm yields Mazes with a low "river" factor, only slightly higher than Kruskal's algorithm. (This means for a given size there are more Mazes with a low "river" factor than high "river", since an average equal probability Maze has low "river".) The bad thing about this algorithm is that it's very slow, since it doesn't do any intelligent hunting for the last cells, where in fact it's not even guaranteed to terminate. However since the algorithm is simple it can move over many cells quickly, so finishes faster than one might think. On average it takes about seven times longer to run than the above algorithms, although in bad cases it can take much longer if the random number generator keeps making it avoid the last few cells. This can be done as a wall adder if the boundary wall is treated as a single vertex, i.e. if a move goes to the boundary wall, teleport to a random point along the boundary before moving again. As a wall adder this runs nearly twice as fast, because the boundary wall teleportation allows quicker access to distant parts of the Maze.
