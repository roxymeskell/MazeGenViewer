    /// Class to generate a maze using the Hunt and Kill algorithm
    /// Extends MazeGeneration
    /// About algorithm --
    /// This algorithm is nice because it requires no extra storage or stack, and is therefore suited to creating the largest Mazes or Mazes on the most limited systems, since there are no issues of running out of memory. Since there are no rules that must be followed all the time, it's also the easiest to modify and to get to create Mazes of different textures. It's most similar to the recursive backtracker, except when there's no unmade cell next to the current position, you enter "hunting" mode, and systematically scan over the Maze until an unmade cell is found next to an already carved into cell, at which point you start carving again at that new location. The Maze is done when all cells have been scanned over once in "hunt" mode. This algorithm tends to make Mazes with a high "river" factor, but not as high as the recursive backtracker. You can make this generate Mazes with a lower river factor by choosing to enter "hunt" mode more often. It runs slower due to the time spent hunting for the last cells, but isn't much slower than Kruskal's algorithm. This can be done as a wall adder if you randomly teleport on occasion, to avoid the issues the recursive backtracker has.
